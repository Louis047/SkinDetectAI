# SkinDetect AI ‚Äì Dermatology Visual AI Application

An end-to-end, cloud-native web app that uses AI to analyze skin conditions from user-uploaded images. Built with React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Google Cloud services (Firebase Auth, Firestore, Cloud Storage, AutoML Vision).  

> **Why SkinDetect AI?**  
> Many existing solutions lack real-time inference, explainability, or fair-data practices. SkinDetect AI addresses these gaps by delivering:  
> 1. **Serverless scalability** ‚Äì front-end to back-end fully managed on GCP.  
> 2. **Fairness & auditability** ‚Äì logs every upload and prediction to Firestore; lifecycle rules for data retention.  
> 3. **Explainability pipeline (future)** ‚Äì designed to plug in Grad-CAM or other saliency tools.  
> 4. **Cost control** ‚Äì built to live within free-tier limits, with budget alerts.

## üì¶ Tech Stack Overview

- **Frontend**  
  - **Framework**: React 18 + Vite + TypeScript  
  - **Styling/UI**: Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui components  
  - **State Management**: TanStack Query (for caching + background fetch)  
  - **HTTP Client**: Axios (for calling Cloud Functions)  
  - **Authentication**: Firebase Auth (Email/Password + Google Sign-In)

- **Backend & Cloud Services**  
  - **Authentication & Database**: Firebase Auth + Firestore (NoSQL)  
  - **Object Storage**: Google Cloud Storage (user images, training data)  
  - **Serverless Compute**: Cloud Functions (Node.js 18)  
    - **Endpoint 1**: `/skinStub` ‚Äì returns dummy or AutoML predictions  
    - **Endpoint 2**: `/uploadImage` ‚Äì (future) stores raw image + metadata  
  - **AutoML Vision** (Cloud AutoML)  
    - Managed training & hosting of the skin-disease classification model  
  - **CI/CD & Deployment**: Vercel (frontend) + gcloud/Cloud Build (backend)

- **Monitoring & Budget Control**  
  - **Stackdriver Monitoring** ‚Äì logs function errors, latency  
  - **Budget Alerts** ‚Äì email/SMS when approaching free-tier limits
